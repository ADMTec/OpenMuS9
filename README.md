[CENTER][SIZE=7]OpenMu Season9[/SIZE]

Hey guys i'm gonna make a threat of a project that i have started to learn programming more and understand
more of the MU sources from client and server. The game is nice and not to big in source code so i was thinking i wanna know more of this game how it work. I have a Ragezone account from 2010 and have tried to make server run in that time now i wanna learn more from the code and share it with you peeps so we can make it work to build a nice server for all of us. There are nice source posted the last time from zTeam S8 and TitansTech and i will use the one from Zteam S8. I have played with zTeam server and Main 1.05.13 and Clientbase from michi28 s9. Now i have a server working called OpenMu Season 9 and it's working on Windows 10 and SQL2014 VS2015. I will explain in this threat how you can do that by your self by movie and forum posts in this threat i will update this threat with all the things u need [COLOR="#FF0000"]STAY TUNED[/COLOR]. If you wanna follow this tutorial u need to install Visual Studio 2015 and SQL2014 and u can use Windows10 it is not important. I just work 4 days on this, have it working with bugs but let see what happens. I know that there are peeple on the forum that also wanna learn and this will be a post with my findings of how i do things and will share with you.

After this i will go to change the main and client and server code for season9. Hope that you get it working the same i got till now any questions ask. Don't know if i do it good way but this is what i know and have learned. The client is hook to dll so you can copy the dll with your changes to the main to the client map. You got nice S8 solution to modify code and run it.
